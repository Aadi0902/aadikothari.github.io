      abstract = {Human motion prediction is an essential step for efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. Current methods either purely rely on representing the human joints in some form of neural network-based architecture or use regression models offline to fit hyper-parameters in the hope of capturing a model encompassing human motion. While these methods provide good initial results, they are missing out on leveraging well-studied human body kinematic models as well as body and scene constraints which can help boost the efficacy of these prediction frameworks while also explicitly avoiding implausible human joint configurations. We propose a novel human motion prediction framework that incorporates human joint constraints and scene constraints in a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to predict human motion over a set time horizon. This formulation is combined with an online context-aware constraints model to leverage task-dependent motions. It is tested on a human arm kinematic model and implemented on a human-robot collaborative setup with a UR5 robot arm to demonstrate the real-time capability of our approach. Simulations were also performed on datasets like HA4M and ANDY. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements in a Gaussian Process framework when these constraints are explicitly considered.}

abstract = {Autonomous motorsports aim to replicate the human race-car driver with software and
sensors. As in traditional motorsports, Autonomous Racing Vehicles (ARVs) are pushed to their
handling limits in multiagent scenarios at extremely high (≥150 mph) speeds. This Operational
Design Domain (ODD) presents unique challenges across the autonomy stack. The Indy Autonomous
Challenge (IAC) is an international competition aiming to advance autonomous vehicle development
through ARV competitions. While far from challenging what a human race-car driver can do, the
IAC is pushing the state of the art by facilitating full-sized ARV competitions. This paper details
the MIT-Pitt-RW Team’s approach to autonomous racing in the IAC. In this work, we present
our modular and fast approach to agent detection, motion planning and controls to create an
autonomy stack. We also provide analysis of the performance of the software stack in single and
multiagent scenarios for rapid deployment in a fast-paced competition environment. We also cover
what did and did not work when deployed on a physical system (the Dallara AV-21 platform)
and potential improvements to address these shortcomings. Finally, we convey lessons learned and
discuss limitations and future directions for improvement.}

abstract = {Robust autonomy stacks require tight integration of perception, motion planning, and control layers, but these layers often inadequately incorporate inherent perception and prediction uncertainties, either ignoring them altogether or making questionable assumptions of Gaussianity. Robots with nonlinear dynamics and complex sensing modalities operating in an uncertain environment demand more careful consideration of how uncertainties propagate across stack layers. We propose a framework to integrate perception, motion planning, and control by explicitly incorporating perception and prediction uncertainties into planning so that risks of constraint violation can be mitigated. Specifically, we use a nonlinear model predictive control based steering law coupled with a decorrelation scheme based Unscented Kalman Filter for state and environment estimation to propagate the robot state and environment uncertainties. Subsequently, we use distributionally robust risk constraints to limit the risk in the presence of these uncertainties. Finally, we present a layered autonomy stack consisting of a nonlinear steering-based distributionally robust motion planning module and a reference trajectory tracking module. Our numerical experiments with nonlinear robot models and an urban driving simulator show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.}
